## Failure modes

Runs by how they ended. API-error runs are left out of everything below; rerun them first.

|  | featherloop |
|---|---:|
| out of budget: iterating | 23 |
| passed | 34 |

## Paired comparisons

Cases both ran cleanly, where exactly one passed: wins each way, and an exact two-sided sign test.

(none)

## Split cases

Cases some columns passed and others failed, with how each failure ended.

(none)

## Reasoning

Characters of reasoning per finished response, and before the first edit: how much a harness has the model think, and how early.

|  | median / response | p90 | over 20k | turns to first edit | reasoning before it (median) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| featherloop | 432 | 3.1k | 0% | 2 | 3.4k |

## After failing tests

The response right after a tool result with failing tests: does the model act, or deliberate?

|  | test runs / run | failing results | next response: median reasoning | over 20k | test output chars (median / p90) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| featherloop | 4.3 | 185 | 1.4k | 2% | 2.4k / 12k |

## Iterating

Tests passing at each test run, and what moved them: does a run build on what passes, or lose it? Fell: a test run passing fewer than the one before. Lost: runs whose last test run passed fewer than their best. Rewrites: whole-file writes to a file already written, once some tests passed. Cut: test commands piped through head or tail, which can hide the failures and the summary.

|  | runs with 2+ test runs | fell / run | lost | best − last, median | rewrites / run | cut test commands |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| featherloop | 53 | 1.8 | 12 | 10 | 8.8 | 230 of 432 (53%) |

## Long responses

Responses over 5 minutes, and the share of timed-out runs' time they took.

|  | count | share of timed-out time | longest finished response, median (min) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| featherloop | 1 | 0% | 0.8 |

## Web use

Fetches and searches, and URLs in shell commands. Solution sources are hosts where solutions to the cases are published: check what was fetched.

|  | fetches / run | runs with any | hosts | from solution sources |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| featherloop | 0.00 | 0 | – | – |

## Possibly hardcoded

Short solutions returning literals from the tests (guards.ts): look before trusting the pass.

(none)

## Runaway responses

Timeouts and budget stops that ended inside one response. Repeated: the share of its reasoning lines (over 20 characters) that repeat an earlier one.

(none)
